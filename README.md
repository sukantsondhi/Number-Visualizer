# Number-Visualizer

A machine learning web application that recognizes handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Draw a digit on the canvas, and the AI will predict what number you drew!

## Features

- 🎨 Interactive drawing canvas for digit input
- 🤖 Deep learning model trained on MNIST dataset
- 📊 Real-time prediction with confidence scores
- 📈 Probability distribution for all digits (0-9)
- 💻 Clean and responsive web interface
- 🚀 Easy to set up and use

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model training
- **Flask**: Web framework for API server
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Image processing

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with gradients and animations
- **JavaScript**: Canvas drawing and API interaction

### Model Architecture
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images
- 2 Convolutional layers with MaxPooling
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Dense layers for classification
- Output: 10 classes (digits 0-9)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or 3.11 (recommended)
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sukantsondhi/Number-Visualizer.git
   cd Number-Visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the model**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Download the MNIST dataset automatically
   - Train a CNN model (takes 5-10 minutes)
   - Save the trained model to `models/mnist_model.keras` (modern format)
   - Generate a training history plot at `static/metrics/training_history.png`

4. **Run the web application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   For development with debug mode:
   ```bash
   FLASK_DEBUG=true python app.py
   ```
### One-liner (Windows)

Prefer a single command that sets everything up? Use the helper script:

```powershell
scripts\run.ps1
```

It will create/activate a venv, install dependencies, train the model if needed, and start the app.


5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, it's recommended to:

1. **Disable debug mode** (default behavior)
2. **Use a production WSGI server** like Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```
3. **Use a reverse proxy** like Nginx
4. **Enable HTTPS** with SSL certificates

## Usage

1. **Draw a Digit**: Use your mouse or touchscreen to draw a digit (0-9) on the canvas
2. **Get Prediction**: Click the "Recognize Digit" button
3. **View Results**: See the predicted digit, confidence score, and probability distribution
4. **Try Again**: Click "Clear Canvas" to draw another digit

## Model Format & Performance

The model is saved in the native Keras format (`.keras`). The server will also accept legacy HDF5 (`.h5`) if present, but `.keras` is preferred for forward compatibility.

The trained CNN model achieves:
- **Test Accuracy**: ~99%
- **Training Time**: 5-10 minutes on CPU
- **Model Size**: ~3 MB

## API Endpoints

### `GET /`
Serves the main web application

### `POST /predict`
Predicts a digit from an uploaded image

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_data"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "digit": 7,
  "confidence": 0.9876,
  "probabilities": {
    "0": 0.0001,
    "1": 0.0002,
    "2": 0.0003,
    "3": 0.0004,
    "4": 0.0005,
    "5": 0.0006,
    "6": 0.0007,
    "7": 0.9876,
    "8": 0.0008,
    "9": 0.0009
  }
}
```

### `GET /health`
Health check endpoint

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Training Phase** (`train_model.py`):
   - Loads the MNIST dataset (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images)
   - Normalizes pixel values to [0, 1]
   - Trains a CNN with 2 convolutional layers
   - Saves the trained model

2. **Inference Phase** (`app.py`):
   - User draws a digit on the canvas
   - Canvas image is sent to the Flask server
   - Image is preprocessed (resized to 28x28, normalized)
   - Model predicts the digit
   - Results are returned to the frontend

3. **Frontend** (`static/`):
   - HTML5 Canvas for drawing
   - JavaScript handles drawing events
   - Sends image data to backend API
   - Displays prediction results with visualizations

## Troubleshooting

### Model not found error
- Make sure you've run `python train_model.py` first
- Check that `models/mnist_model.h5` exists

### Poor prediction accuracy
- Try drawing digits larger and centered
- Make sure the digit is dark on a light background
- Clear the canvas and try again

### Server won't start
- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Make sure all dependencies are installed
- Verify Python version is 3.8 or higher

### TensorFlow import errors
- Ensure your virtual environment uses Python 3.10 or 3.11
- Reinstall dependencies inside the venv:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Then verify:
   ```powershell
   python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
   ```

## Security

This application implements several security best practices:

- **Debug mode disabled by default**: Prevents exposure of sensitive debugging information
- **Error message sanitization**: Stack traces are not exposed to users
- **Input validation**: Images are validated before processing
- **Safe dependencies**: All dependencies are regularly updated for security

For production deployment, additional security measures should be implemented:
- Use HTTPS/SSL encryption
- Implement rate limiting
- Add authentication if needed
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regular security audits and updates

## PR Readiness Checklist

Use this checklist when opening a pull request:
- App runs locally: `python app.py` serves UI and `/predict` works
- Model present or reproducible: `python train_model.py` succeeds
- README updated with any changes to setup or run
- No large, unused artifacts committed (e.g., datasets, temporary files)
- Code adheres to project style and keeps changes minimal and focused
